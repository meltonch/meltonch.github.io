This game is called Space Shooter. It should include three graphical objects, including the space ship, lasers,
 and aliens. These are animated using sprite sheets and the draw function called multiple times with the
 setInterval function. Interaction involves a crude bounded box algorithm utilizing the size of the image sprites.
Lasers do not appear when the space bar is pressed. If the game worked, each alien kill would be worth 
100 points.

INSTRUCTIONS:
	The ship can be moved by pressing the arrow keys. The goal is to avoid and shoot the aliens.
	The ship is supposed to fire lasers when the spacebar is pressed, but it doesn't.
