					<p>I'm Chase, and I created Anonymous Waffle as a showcase for things I've done, as well as 
					a site to host other things (like perhaps a minecraft server, at some point?). I do all kinds of things 
					with code and technology, from web applications to Java applications, from simple, single-page games to 
					more complex applications implementing technologies such as JavaFX for UI design and CUDA for parallelization.
					The site itself is pretty simple. It's written in HTML with CSS styling, and the interactivity is designed with 
					a few lines of jQuery. I took the background picture myself, and the color design for the site was intended to 
					fit the image. For now, the site is hosted through GitHub Pages, for which I thank them. If you have any further 
					questions, comments, or suggestions, please check the contact page for ways in which you can contact me. If you'd 
					like to view some of the projects I've done, check out the Projects page. If you're interested in changes to the 
					site and when they're being made, check out the Log page.</p>
