		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>My name is Chase Melton, and this is a site I've 
			created for the purpose of hosting games I create 
			for CSCI 4070 in the Spring of 2015. This "about" 
			section will contain all information relevant to 
			the games, while the games page will only contain 
			the games themselves for simplicity (who wants to 
			read blocks of text when there's games to be played?)
			<br>
			<br>
			There's not much around yet, but check back often for 
			updates and more. </p>
